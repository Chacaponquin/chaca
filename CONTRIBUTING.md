2. Fork the repository.
3. Write tests for your fix or feature.
4. Implement your fix or feature.
5. Open a pull a request.
6. Ensure that the code quality and test coverage checks pass.

## Testing

To get up and running, install the dependencies and run the tests:

```shell
npm run test
npm run test:cases  # test examples schema cases
npm run test:export # test code export cases
npm run test:schemas # test defined schema fields
npm run test:library # test library functions, utils, schemas
npm run test:utils # test library utils

```

## Code Style

The project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting. If your editor isn't set up to work with them, you can lint and format all files from the command line using `npm run fix` or `yarn fix`.
